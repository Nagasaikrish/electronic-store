        <p>The design of the flag of India that was first presented in 1921 to Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the All-India Congress, was created by Pingali (or Pinglay) Venkayya. It consisted of the colours associated with the two principal religions, red for Hindus and green for Muslims.</p>

        <p> The Census Organization of India is one of the largest producers of maps in the country. It has nearly 130 years of experience of disseminating census data and publications of maps. Standards of cartographic excellence can be seen in the geographical maps published in the census reports of 1872 of North-West Provinces, Cochin, Bengal and the very excellent volume of maps of different collectorates of the Bombay Presidency of the same decade, the five taluk maps of Mysore state published in census report of 1891, maps published in the Encyclopedia Linguistic Survey of India, the state census reports of 1931, the Special All India Ethnographic Appendix published in 1933 and the maps included in the District Census Handbooks of 1951 onwards. A major shift in mapping census data however, was witnessed during Census of India 1961 when the first Census Atlas of 1961 was published in 1968. In addition, the state and union territory atlases were also published as a sequel. The tradition continued in the subsequent censuses also.

            When Venkayya attended the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session in 1906 in Calcutta under the leadership of Dadabhai Naoroji, he was inspired to design a flag for the Indian National Congress as he opposed the idea of hoisting the British flag at Congress meetings.[2] Venkayya worked on potential designs that could be used as flags for the newly coined Swaraj movement to signify independence. There were over 25 drafts of the flags with different significance and relations with Indian culture, heritage and history. In 1916, he published a book titled Bharatha Desaniki Oka Jatiya Patakam (transl.â€‰A National Flag for India) with 30 potential designs for a flag.[12][14] From 1918 to 1921, he proposed various ideas to the Congress leadership while also working at the Andhra National College in Machilipatnam
